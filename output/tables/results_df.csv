"13752",13752," 愼㸰 USA TODAY SLEEP HOT LINE; Sleepless in America It's no wonder people in this country are short on sleep: They don't cultivate good sleep habits. Among the findings released Wednesday of a National Sleep Foundation poll of 1,014 adults: * 40% say they are so sleepy during the day that it interferes with their daily activities. * A third of adults do not keep a regular sleep schedule -- that is, they don't go to bed and get up at the same time every day, which sleep doctors recommend. * 21% drink a caffeinated beverage at night, which experts advise against. These bad habits are contributing to a sleep-deprived America, experts say. The poll shows that adults fall far short of their recommended daily sleep allowance: * The average adult sleeps six hours and 58 minutes during the workweek -- an hour less than the eight hours recommended by sleep experts. * 30% of adults usually sleep 6 1/2 hours per night or less during the workweek. * Only 35% of adults sleep the recommended eight hours per night during the workweek. What do people do to solve their sleep problems? * A quarter of adults have taken a medication to help them sleep during the past year (29% of women; 19% of men). * Of those who take sleeping medications, 53% take only over-the-counter sleep aids; 38% take only prescription medications; 9% take both types. * 38% of adults nap at least once during the workweek. * The average nap is one hour during the workweek and one hour and 15 minutes on the weekends.

Teen-agers complained more than younger children. * 15% of children told their parents that they had fallen asleep at school during the past year. ",1999,"USA TODAY; McLean, Va."
"12709",12709," 愼㸰 Every Tuesday: Discoveries, breakthroughs and trends; See related stories: 06D Many busy people argue that with demanding jobs, commuting and family obligations there simply isn't time to sleep eight hours a night. Are they doomed? It depends on whom you ask. There are some experts who argue that eight hours of sleep a night may not really be necessary. Jim Horne, with the sleep research laboratory at Loughborough University in England, says many people do very well on seven to 7 hours a night. ""I don't think the evidence is strong enough (to support sleeping eight hours). Most adults in the U.S. who sleep seven to 7 hours do not suffer from excessive sleepiness in the daytime,"" he says. ""They may have a dip in the afternoon, but it's not necessary for them to sleep another hour or an hour and a half during the night. They should just take a short sleep in the afternoon."" Horne also disagrees with researchers who say if you need an alarm clock to get up you haven't had enough sleep. ""A lot of people wake up just before the alarm. They use it to reassure themselves they'll get up on time rather than to wake themselves up."" Studies in his laboratory showed that people were able to extend their sleeping time from seven or 7 hours to nine or 9 hours. But, he says, ""just saying they can take nine hours of sleep doesn't mean they need it. We can drink fluids without being thirsty. We can eat foods without being hungry.""

"22277",22277," Bob and Shari Buelt's waterfront home is a study in elegance. The floors are gleaming mahogany, tasteful paintings decorate the kitchen walls and each room has a wonderful view of Budd Inlet in Olympia. And the home rocks everyone to sleep at night. The Buelts and their two daughters, Sydney and Annie, live aboard S/V Pearl, the family's 49-foot-long sailboat. ""It's just a simpler life, and we don't have to pack when we go on vacation. We take our home on vacation with us,"" Shari Buelt said. Life for liveaboards is simpler by design, and that includes simpler finances. A home mortgage -- and property taxes -- are history, although some liveaboards do have boat mortgages. Liveaboards do pay for utilities, but their waste-water pumpout is included in their slip rental. Swantown monthly slip rental varies from $5.76 per foot of boat to $7.58 per foot, plus a nearly 13 percent tax -- creating an often smaller bottom line. And liveaboards don't have a lot of room, so they don't spend much on furniture or anything else that could create clutter. Bob and Shari Buelt lived in a nice Portland, Ore., neighborhood, but they dreamed of living on a boat and cruising to the South Pacific. Living the dream meant selling their home, furniture and most of the stuff that people collect over a lifetime, buying their boat, and moving to Swantown Marina. Eventually, that also means making that dream cruise a reality. ""Mexico, Hawaii and New Zealand,"" said Sydney with a big smile. At Swantown Marina, Lester and Meridee Marsh live aboard their 42-foot Chris-Craft. ""I paid $1,500 for a small 28-foot boat on a Monday, and we cleaned it up that Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,"" Marsh said. ""Then we decided to stay the weekend, and we didn't want to go home."" They sold the house and made that little boat home for four years. Then Lester bought a 50-foot retired U.S. Navy launch, and the couple made it home until the Chris-Craft floated into their lives. Being close to nature and being rocked to sleep every night -- along with no more lawn mowing -- are just a few of the pleasures, Marsh said. ""But you also get to know the best people,"" Marsh said. ""I lived in a house in Tacoma for 22 years, and I knew one neighbor. ""Down here, I know dozens of people, and I talk to them every day.""

"17595",17595," Napping on the job (or elsewhere) may have many benefits, but perhaps a more important issue is why so many people apparently need that afternoon snooze (""As Bosses Nap, Cubicle Dwellers Doze Under Clever Disguise,"" Cubicle Culture, July 23). In this country, one obvious reason for napping is that millions of Americans are sleep deprived. In fact, according to a recent National Sleep Foundation poll, one-quarter of American adults say they don't get the minimum amount of sleep they need to be alert the next day. The result is what appears to be an epidemic of daytime sleepiness that can affect cognition, performance, and even mood and behavior. While you correctly point out that napping can restore alertness, it cannot replace a good night's sleep, which for most adults means seven to nine hours of uninterrupted sleep. For some, a daytime nap can impede nighttime sleep. Daytime sleepiness and the resulting need to nap could be a sign of insufficient sleep or an untreated sleep disorder that may be undermining health. It is worth discussing with a physician or other health-care provider. Richard L. Gelula Executive Director National Sleep Foundation Washington ",2003,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition; New York, N.Y."
"14561",14561," 愼㸰 Sleepless in America: A better Life: Health, education & science A good night's sleep improves memory and learning, according to research out this month. A study out last fall showed that sleep loss mimics some of the effects of aging, suggesting that sleep loss may increase the severity of age-related diseases such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Those findings add to a growing body of evidence on the benefits of getting enough sleep. For years, sleep researchers have touted the mental and physical rewards of shut-eye. They say that getting enough sleep makes people more alert and productive and puts them in better moods. And they say tired kids are more likely to fall asleep in school, and worn-out adults can drift off at a cocktail party or business meeting or even while driving a car. ""Sleep deprivation makes you stupid,"" says pioneer sleep researcher William Dement, author of The Promise of Sleep with Christopher Vaughan (Dell, $14.95). When you are tired or sleep- deprived, the brain tries to go to sleep. ""It's not trying to pay attention and be brilliant; it's trying to go to sleep. It's astounding to me how many people don't do anything about it."" Most people need seven to nine hours of sleep a night, experts say. But people, on average, are getting a little less than seven hours, research shows. ""If you get drowsy or sleepy at any time during the day, you are by definition sleep-deprived,"" says Dement, of Stanford University. Those people who get less sleep than the body needs build what experts call a sleep debt. The debt accumulates over time and takes a toll on people's motor and intellectual functions. Sleep debt cannot be ignored indefinitely, Dement says. ""Sleep debt is always driving the brain toward sleep."" Even a little sleep debt can affect people. ""You can show the effects of two hours of sleep loss on human performance,"" says Thomas Roth, head of the division of sleep medicine at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. If you have a sleep debt of 10 hours or more, your performance is going to be impaired, and ""I don't want you driving a school bus or flying a 747 across the Atlantic,"" Roth says. For optimal functioning, it's best to get enough sleep every night. But if you can't, experts say, you should try to make up for the sleep loss as soon as you can. Many people try to catch up on lost shut-eye by sleeping in on the weekends or taking naps. Often that only makes a small dent in a large sleep debt, Dement says. He says people who need an alarm clock to wake up on time often are jolted out of a deep sleep because the brain is not ready to wake up. ""Whoever invented the snooze button understood that it takes a barrage of wake-up calls to rouse the severely sleep-deprived.""

"15502",15502," Kindergartners do it. And apparently so does President George W. Bush. They all take a midday nap. Bush recently quipped to reporters that he was going to answer questions, then ""head on home and take a nap."" There's no way of telling if the president's mini-shut-eyes are going make napping at work more popular or acceptable. But there's little doubt that for some people--including Bush-- taking a midday nap is a good thing, sleep specialists say. It's a good way to recharge human batteries, they say. Unfortunately, American society still undervalues naps, and napping at work is often misunderstood as laziness. Here's what you should know about midday naps, according to the National Sleep Foundation and ""The Promise of Sleep"" by William Dement and Christopher Vaughan (DTP, $14.95). Our bodies are more likely to nap after lunch and during the midday hours. A 15- to 20-minute nap can improve alertness, sharpen memory and generally reduce the symptoms of fatigue. Some people may need more or less time. A nap is not a substitute for a full night's sleep; it is only a short-term solution. If you're coping with the effect of lost sleep or you know you're going to lose sleep tonight, a nap can help. It could spell the difference between life and death if you're sleep-deprived and planning on a long drive. If getting to sleep or staying asleep at night is a problem, naps are probably not for you. There's a history of napping presidents. According to Dement, Lyndon Johnson was a dedicated napper, donning pajamas and sleeping half an hour. ",2001,"Chicago Tribune; Chicago, Ill."

"22493",22493," In a quest to look younger, be healthier and feel more vital later in life, increasing numbers of men, just like Jeffry Life, are turning to testosterone and human growth hormone. Use of both hormones is controversial. Read on: Testosterone: ""Older men . . . go to their physicians and say, 'I don't have energy, I don't have sex interest, I can't get around,' "" said Dr. Thomas Gill, professor of geriatric medicine and director of the Center on Disability and Disabling Disorders at the Yale University School of Medicine. Increasingly, what they get is testosterone. In 1999, 64,800 prescriptions were filled in the U.S.; by 2008, that number had jumped to 3.3 million, according to IMS Health Inc., a company that provides data to the healthcare industry. One reason for this growth, Gill says, is the creation -- and heavy marketing -- of a gel form of testosterone, which was previously available only via injection, patches or implantable pellets. Low testosterone levels do become more common in men as they age: Levels start falling at around age 30 and decrease by 1% to 2% per year, with ranges generally falling between 300 and 1,000 nanograms of testosterone per deciliter of blood depending on age. The decline may increase past 65. But it is unclear whether the issues associated with aging in men -- decreased sex drive, less energy, cognitive impairment and reduced muscle mass -- are due to a decrease in testosterone or to other changes that come with aging, Gill says. Long-term studies on effectiveness of the therapy are lacking, and the few small, shorter-term trials that exist have produced mixed results. A 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. looked at mobility, cognition, bone mineral density, quality of life and other issues in 237 men in the Netherlands. The participants, ages 60 to 80, were given either a placebo or testosterone over a six-month period. Lean body mass increased and fat decreased in the testosterone group, but mobility and muscle strength did not change. There was improvement in insulin sensitivity (in which cells become less sensitive to insulin, forcing the body to overproduce it). But more of the testosterone group had metabolic syndrome, a cluster of health risk factors that include obesity, high blood pressure, inflammation and high cholesterol. No difference in quality-of-life measures (such as vitality, mood improvements and social functioning) was detected between the two groups. A New England Journal of Medicine article from October 2006 reported similar results in a two-year study of 87 elderly men. The Mayo Clinic authors found that increasing testosterone in men with low levels did not increase muscle strength, physical performance or quality of life. Doctors are concerned about side effects associated with testosterone. Potential problems include the worsening of sleep apnea, enlargement of the prostate and overproduction of red blood cells, which can cause a stroke if the levels climb too high. And because the treatment can raise blood levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the marker screened for in prostate cancer tests, it may lead to detection of very slow-growing cancers that would never have presented problems to the patient. This can lead to unnecessary treatments with potential for side effects such as incontinence or impotence. According to the National Institute on Aging, men who have extreme testosterone deficiencies related to damage of the testes or pituitary glands from trauma, infections or tumors may benefit from testosterone supplementation. But the institute says more research is needed to see if replacement therapy will help those without such extreme issues -- and to fully understand the potential long-term side effects. To try and fill in some of the unknowns, Gill and others are working on one of the largest testosterone trials to date, to take place at 12 medical centers across the country. Eight hundred men with low testosterone will receive either testosterone or a placebo for a year and be monitored for changes in vitality, sexual and cognitive function, anemia, bone density and cardiovascular health. Potential participants are currently being screened; more information can be found at www.ttrial.org. Human growth hormone: Human growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland, located at the base of the brain. The hormone helps fuel growth and maintains tissues and organs; after age 25, the amount of hormone released begins to decrease, dropping by about 50% every seven years, according to some estimates. Supplementation was initially used just for children with HGH deficiency, which made them unable to attain a ""normal"" height. It has also been used for adolescents and adults who have had their pituitary gland removed because of a tumor or other issue. The hormone is administered by injection. Though it has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating elderly individuals experiencing physical decline, it is being used ""off label"" for this purpose. Again, research on the safety and benefits of HGH is mixed, and the National Institute on Aging says there is no conclusive evidence that the hormone can reduce the physical decline that comes with age. A 2007 Annals of Internal Medicine review of HGH did find some benefits. The article, which analyzed 31 research studies on a total of 220 elderly male participants, observed that those who were treated with HGH had reduced fat mass and increased lean body mass. The review also found that participants' weight, bone density and serum lipid levels did not change. But the men who got the hormone were more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome, fluid buildup in the soft tissues or to develop diabetes. The National Institute on Aging cautions against using growth hormone therapy for anti-aging purposes, citing only short-term studies on its effectiveness as well as potential risks such as diabetes, joint pain, heart failure and cancer. By time people are 80, HGH levels are virtually undetectable, but that may be a protective mechanism, according to Dr. Shlomo Melmed, senior vice president and dean of faculty at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. ""It is part of the normal aging process and may be protective against cancers related to aging,"" he said. ""The science is against this -- it is a dangerous medicine and has a lot of side effects."" HGH therapy is also controversial because of its cost, which can run upward of $15,000 a year, says Dr. Ronald Swerdloff, professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine. ""We need more data on effectiveness and adverse effects,"" Swerdloff says. ""An industry has developed . . . where special clinics or groups are promoting testosterone and HGH rather indiscriminately for people. . . . But nothing we do will prevent people from getting older."" -- health@latimes.com ",2010,"Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles, Calif."
"4433",4433," Working women sleep about 25 minutes less per night than their male counterparts, though the average woman sleeps slightly longer than the average man, researchers said last week. ""One possible explanation is that a woman who works still has to maintain a lot of household duties,"" said Jeff Biddle, assistant professor of economics at the University of Michigan. ""They aren't spending much less time doing those things, and their husbands aren't sharing chores with them, so the time has to come from somewhere and often it comes from sleep time,"" he said. The study of the sleep habits of 1,500 people also found that people who hold jobs sleep less than people who don't work and that for every extra hour worked, a person sleeps 15 minutes less. Men who earn a higher wage per hour sleep less than lower-paid men, the researchers found, but that pattern fails to hold up for women. Wide variances in the amount of time people sleep were turned up by the study, with 10% reporting they sleep less than 6.5 hours a night and 10% reporting they sleep more than 9 hours. ""Although it's true we do need a certain amount of sleep, we do have some control,"" Biddle said. ""How much time is valued is going to enter into that decision.""

"25268",25268," 愼㸰 The earliest scouting report on Daniel Murphy, from his middle school coach in Jacksonville, Fla., went something like this: ""Not the fastest guy. Doesn't have a great arm. But he can hit."" More than a decade and a half later, when Murphy became a free agent for the first time, the scouting reports read similarly. Murphy is not a strong defensive player. He is not a stolen-base threat. Murphy is a hitter, always has been, one uncommonly consumed by the craft. The Nationals will pay him $37.5 million over three years in the hope that their lineup will benefit from his commitment. Long before the postseason fates exposed the highs and lows of Murphy's game under the brightest possible lights, before he could not stop homering -- then could not field a ground ball that helped the World Series pivot the Royals' way -- Murphy was a freshman at Englewood High School, crushing junior varsity pitching. When Coach Lee Geiger pulled him up to the varsity, he threw him into the eighth inning of a game against a highly ranked team. Murphy hit a game-winning single in his first at-bat. That single, Geiger remembers, went through the left side of the infield. Murphy wasn't pulling the ball much then, still developing the confidence to trust his hands on inside pitches. Once he learned to do that, and thanks in part to unusually long hours in the batting cages, he began to separate himself from other high school hitters. ""It was all upper .300s, .400s the rest of his high school career,"" said Geiger, who can still recount that middle school scouting report. ""He's one of the guys that always hit, worked in the cage. He worked on his fielding, but you could tell hitting was his love."" No one heavily recruited Murphy out of high school. Only one school, Jacksonville University, offered him a scholarship. New York Mets scout Steve Barningham saw Murphy play at Jacksonville, where he grew into the Atlantic Sun player of the year as a junior in 2006. Barningham liked the short swing, the fact that Murphy hardly ever swung and missed, and his presence. Most amateur players, Barningham said, allow pitchers to dictate pace. Professional hitters control it, with routine and patience and presence. Murphy, he said, was ""in complete control."" Intrigued, but not sure how to sell a player with no obvious ""plus"" tools to the Mets' front office, Barningham took Murphy to lunch. ""One of the smartest things I ever did,"" Barningham says now. ""Five minutes into that lunch, I was blown away. I had never heard an amateur remember his at-bats in such detail, remember sequences,"" Barningham said. ""His at-bat recall was as good as I'd ever heard anywhere."" Talking a good game Scouts check up on the players they sign as those players make their way through the minor leagues. Often, early on, players don't know who to confide in, because coaches control their fate and players are their competition. Barningham would answer the phone and listen. ""The more he played, the more [calls] came,"" Barningham said of Murphy. ""He just loves to talk hitting and talk about his at-bats. I simply answer the phone and he goes. He loves to talk about hitting."" Murphy can recall at-bats -- his and those of teammates -- pitch by pitch. Sit near him in the dugout, and he will volunteer his thoughts on the fastball he saw in that 2-0 count, or about the break on that particular reliever's slider. Murphy hollered ""let's go!"" when he took the infield for the first time in late February. Known as one who chatters, Murphy jabbered through all of spring training's sometimes dull defensive drills, telling teammates good job, that he had it or they did. But on the bench and in the clubhouse, he talks about hitting. ""He loves talking about hitting,"" Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman said. ""That's the kind of guy he is. Playing against him so long, you could get a feel for who he is. My assumption of what he is like is pretty spot on."" Rick Schu said he was struck by the rigid structure of Murphy's hitting work, by his consistent commitment to drills aimed to train his eyes for recognizing pitches. ""He sees the ball really well. He swings at strikes, gets into hitter's counts,"" Schu said. ""I think a lot of it is just his preparation with the eye stuff."" Dusty Baker, who wrote a book about hitting, said Murphy uses hitting drills he's never seen before. ""The guy's work habits are outstanding,"" Baker said. "". . . He's a student of the game, which is really going to rub off on some of the guys here. He's got these balls cut in half that he uses, this ball goes this way and this ball goes that way. I've never seen that. He's a real student. Big time. He's the epitome of a tough out."" Ready to battle at the plate No one in baseball struck out less frequently than Murphy in 2015, who did so in 7.1 percent of his plate appearances. Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo used the word ""grit"" over and over as he explained the decision to sign Murphy. His pitchers hated facing Murphy, Rizzo remembered. He did not give in. ""Everybody I played against was always better than me,"" Murphy said. ""[Being gritty] was the only way they'd let me stay. I was never the best player."" Barningham remembers Murphy's at-bats lasting two or three minutes, longer than most. Zimmerman said Murphy's pesky prowess at the plate comes not just from a knack for contact, but from a mind-set. Murphy said he developed that mind-set over time. When you're constantly thinking about hitting, it can be challenging to stop thinking enough to hit. ""For me, it's about feeling good in there. Once you feel good, we tend to want to hit more because it feels good. But once you hit more, leave it,"" Murphy said. ""If you don't feel good that day, so what?

He is known for his contact, or at least he was until that incomprehensible postseason run in which he hit seven home runs in nine games, including six straight.

""If he sees it, he thinks he can hit it, and even if it's not his strength he'll take the hit,"" Barningham said. ""I think what he's done over the last few years is, 'All right, maybe that's a pitch I can hit for a single, but that's not what I'm looking for here.' . . .

"15499",15499," If you're half asleep as you read this, I'm not surprised. A new study shows that Americans are not getting nearly enough sleep. Two-thirds of us fall short of the eight hours we need nightly for optimum functioning, and the average American adult gets fewer than seven hours a night. According to the study, released this week by the Washington, D.C.-based National Sleep Foundation, we are working more and sleeping less than ever before. ""We're leading the way among industrialized nations in piling up a sleep debt that takes a toll in every area of our lives,"" says Dr. James Walsh, vice president of the foundation, a nonprofit group aimed at improving public health and safety by educating the public about sleep and sleep disorders. ""We're less alert, more tense, more temperamental. . . . We're finding it harder to get through the day."" One-quarter of us have difficulty getting up for work at least a couple times a week. Almost one in seven say they're late for work a few days each month because of sleepiness, and 4% skip work occasionally because they're just too tired to go. Almost one in 10 sometimes fall asleep at their desks, and more than one-third make a beeline for the bed when they get home because they can't get through the evening without a nap. Some employers have recognized the toll that sleepiness takes on productivity. About 16% of companies now allow workers to nap at work. Almost half of their employees take advantage of the benefit and work a siesta into their day. Others are forced to catch naps on the sly. Some, like me, slip out to the parking lot at lunchtime to catch 40 winks in the back seat of the car. * The study coincides with National Sleep Awareness Week, which runs through Sunday. Not coincidentally, that's the day we switch to daylight saving time, with its spring-forward ritual that denies the already sleep-deprived a much-needed hour of weekend snooze time. But what, precisely, do the sleep experts expect us to do about our shut-eye shortfall? I don't know anyone who deliberately deprives himself or herself of sleep. If I'm sleep-starved, it's not my fault. Blame my boss, my kids' teachers, the barking dog next door that keeps me up at night. But Walsh considers that a cop-out, put forth by someone who just hasn't made sleep enough of a priority. He argues we're not just hostages to our responsibilities, but also to bad habits that sabotage our sleep needs. ""I talk to a lot of people who say they can't possibly get eight of hours of sleep a night, and I inquire about what they do,"" he says. ""They say, 'I just have to have time to myself to veg out,' so they watch TV for an hour or they read for an hour."" In fact, the study showed that 43% admit they stay up later than they should because they're watching TV or are on the Internet. ""I'm not saying those things are terrible, but that given the choice between getting enough sleep and watching TV, it seems like that's a no-brainer,"" Walsh says. Walsh has structured his own life so that he gets his eight hours each night. ""It sounds trivial, but I just decided it's that important."" He sympathizes with single parents or split-shift workers whose unforgiving schedules dictate too little sleep. ""But most of us just need to restructure our lives to respect our sleep needs. . . . When my children were old enough to stay up past 10, I just said good night to them at 9:30, and I went off to bed."" * Perhaps we haven't made sleep a priority because we don't understand the toll lack of sleep takes. And because sleep, in and of itself, isn't much fun. ""The problem is sleep doesn't provide immediate gratification like other recreational activities, like watching television or visiting with friends,"" Walsh says. ""Because you're unconscious, it doesn't feel pleasurable. If we could come up with a sleeping pill that could result in people feeling like sleep is entertaining, we would have everyone getting enough sleep."" Short of that kind of medical breakthrough, what has to happen is both a cultural change and a personal commitment to more sleep. ""Being able to say, 'I'm exhausted,' has become a badge of honor,"" Walsh says. ""It's a macho thing. There's this idea that anybody who sleeps eight hours is lazy and can't possibly be productive. So people brag, 'I can get by on five hours of sleep or four hours of sleep.' ""But there's a big difference between getting by and getting enough. Try getting up well-rested, after a few good nights of sleep. And see if you don't know what I mean."" * Sandy Banks' column runs on Fridays and Tuesdays.

"12765",12765," If you think you can get by on less than eight hours' sleep, you may want to read this book. According to James Maas, a Cornell University psychologist and leading sleep researcher, it's the eighth hour of sleep that leads to peak performance. Maas' research shows that the last stage of REM sleep, which typically occurs in the eighth hour, is the most restorative to the brain. Maas is aghast at Americans' sleep habits--most adults get six to seven hours of sleep a night--and has stats to show what a sorry state we're in. For example, the parents of a new baby lose 450 to 700 hours of sleep in the child's first year of life. Maas also says that adolescents need far more sleep (about 10 hours) than they get (about six hours). The book helps readers assess their own sleep problems and provides instruction on how to develop healthy sleep habits. ",1998,"Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles, Calif."
"22130",22130," Unintended Consequences When a new vaccine was approved in 2000, experts hoped it would protect children against a common bacteria that causes a variety of illnesses, including meningitis. They were not disappointed. The vaccine, known as Prevnar, has resulted in a sharp drop in cases. The question was: Would it also reduce cases in adults? A new study led by Lee Hamilton of the University of Pittsburgh says yes. An analysis of data collected between 1998 and 2005 found that overall there was a 30 percent drop in pneumococcal meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The news, however, is not all good. At the same time, there was a 60 percent increase in strains of the bacteria not covered by the vaccine. The reduction in those covered by the vaccine probably created a void that the other strains filled, the researchers speculated. Perhaps even more worrisome, there was an increase in the number of cases caused by strains of the bacteria resistant to antibiotics. -- Rob Stein DCResident00 wrote: Honestly, if I'm getting meningitis, I could care less what strain of bacteria it is. If this vaccine is making other types of bacteria cause meningitis even more . . . then what's the point? Sleep and the Common Cold Direct evidence of a relationship between cold-catching and sleep has been elusive. A new study published in the Jan. 12 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine helps to pin down that link. Researchers led by Sheldon Cohen at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh tracked the self-reported sleep experiences of 153 healthy men and women ages 21 to 55 for 14 days. They then gave each participant nasal drops containing a cold-causing rhinovirus. Not everyone actually developed a cold. Those who slept, on average, less than seven hours per night were nearly three times as likely to develop a cold as those who slept eight or more hours nightly. When researchers looked at ""sleep efficiency,"" the ratio of time spent in bed to time actually sleeping, an even more striking pattern emerged: Those with less than 92 percent efficiency were 5.5 times as likely to develop a cold as those with 98 percent efficiency or better. -- Jennifer Huget chowx417 wrote: I'm usually not susceptible to sickness.

"21785",21785," Americans are not as sleep-deprived as they think they are and, in fact, appear to be getting more Z's these days than they got a few years ago, according to an independent analysis of government statistics. The new findings run counter to the widespread public perception that Americans are getting less and less sleep because of increasing workplace demands and the plethora of distractions available around the clock on the Internet and cable television. ""Many Americans work too much, but most do not seem to be cutting corners on their sleep to do so,"" said John P. Robinson, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, who led the analysis with faculty colleague Steven Martin. Their report, ""Not So Deprived: Sleep in America, 1965-2005,"" scheduled for release by the university today, finds that Americans on average got 59 hours of sleep per week in 2005, the latest year for which precise statistics are available. That is three hours more than in 2000. The new numbers contrast significantly with the 2008 ""Sleep in America"" poll, the oft-quoted survey conducted annually by the Washington-based National Sleep Foundation, which advocates for better diagnosis and treatment of sleep problems. Released last week, that survey concluded that Americans get an average of 48 hours of sleep per week. The difference, experts said, reflects the two groups' methodologies. The Sleep Foundation survey asks Americans to estimate how much sleep they typically get. By contrast, the Maryland analysis draws upon detailed ""time-use"" data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Department of Labor Statistics. In that approach, individuals must account for every minute of the previous day. ""This gives us a much better picture of where the time goes than when people just make an estimate,"" Robinson said. The primary factor affecting the amount of sleep a person gets is whether he or she is employed, the new analysis shows. Apparent differences among men and women and people of varying ages and races effectively disappear when individuals' employment status is taken into account. ""Older people sleep more, but that's because they tend to be unemployed,"" Robinson said. ""If you control for those differences, the differences in sleep disappear, too."" Most surprising are the hints in census data that sleep time may be increasing after many decades of virtually no change. The new data show Americans getting an average of 8.5 hours per night in 2005, compared with eight hours in 2000. Most of the extra minutes of weekly sleep are coming on Saturday nights: 9.5 hours of which were spent slumbering in 2005, compared with 8.8 hours in 2000. Friday night slumber grew to 8.9 hours from 8.5, and workweek sleep grew to 8.2 hours from 7.8. Sociologists at the University of Toronto recently published a report of similar trends in Canada. Addressing the contrast with the National Sleep Foundation data, Robinson said he is not surprised that people who are asked to simply estimate how much sleep they get tend to underestimate. ""It's a status symbol,"" he said. ""If you are a good American, you work all hours. It's virtuous in American society to not get enough sleep."" The Sleep Foundation gets funding from the makers of sleep-related drugs and medical devices but says its surveys are conducted independently. Christopher Drake, a psychologist at Henry Ford Hospital's sleep center in Detroit and a board member of the Sleep Foundation, agreed that sleep estimates are not ideal. However, he added, ""Time-use surveys have issues, too. Tossing and turning from insomnia and the time spent 'waking up' or 'falling asleep' is often counted as 'sleep time' in those surveys."" That can lead to overestimates of time spent sleeping, Drake said, adding that part of the difference may also be because the foundation's survey focused on working Americans. Robinson and Drake agreed that averages do not tell the whole story, and that some parts of society may be getting less sleep these days even as others -- the undereducated and unemployed among them -- may be getting more. ""The message we're trying to get across is not that everyone is sleep-deprived, but there are certain segments of the population living with a regular sleep debt, people getting less than six hours per night,"" Drake said. That includes the one-third of night shift workers who report getting less than six hours of sleep per 24 hours, and the 43 percent of people holding down two jobs who say they get a good night's sleep, on average, only twice a month. That is important, Drake said, and not only because sleepiness can lead to automobile accidents and other life-threatening errors. ""Sleepiness is impairing their work, their relationships with their families and pretty much every aspect of their lives,"" he said. One solution: naps. Less than half of the U.S. population takes two or more naps a month, according to the foundation, and 10 percent have taken a nap during a break at work. ""The bottom line for us is to tell people to make sleep one of their number one priorities,"" Drake said. ""Because if you don't do that, then it easily falls to the bottom of the list.""

"12828",12828," 愼㸰 Adult Americans average less than seven hours of sleep a night during the week, even though experts say that most people need eight hours to function at their best. And many folks try to make up for their shortage of shut-eye by sleeping in or napping on the weekends, says a poll out today, confirming a similar poll done in 1995. The National Sleep Foundation, a nonprofit group, commissioned the new survey of 1,027 adults and found: The average adult gets six hours and 57 minutes of sleep a night during the workweek and seven hours and 31 minutes a night on weekends. Men and women report about the same amount of sleep. 38% take at least one nap on the weekends, and 38% say they took a nap during the past two workweeks. The average length of naps is a little over an hour. Experts say the body has a biological need for a certain amount of sleep. If you don't get enough, you eventually have to catch up. ""How many hours you sleep on the weekend is a very good indicator of how much sleep debt you have,"" says Thomas Roth, head of the sleep medicine division, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit. Young children -- ages 4, 5 and 6 -- usually get enough sleep during the week, so they don't build up a sleep debt. They get up at the same time on weekends, which parents view as getting up too early, Roth says. Other findings from the poll: 51% of men and 42% of women say they would go to sleep earlier if they didn't have a television or access to the Internet. 43% say they are affected a few nights a week or more by at least one symptom of insomnia. For instance, they have difficulty falling or staying asleep. 6% of women and 2% of men report that a doctor has told them they suffer from insomnia. (Researchers estimate that about 10% of the population actually has chronic insomnia or inadequate sleep or poor-quality sleep nightly for a month or more.) 43% report that they snore a few nights a week or more. Of those who snore, 16% say they snore so loudly they can be heard through a closed door, which might be a sign of a sleep disorder. 37% report being so sleepy during the day that it interferes with daily activities. 52% of shift workers (night or evening), compared with 33% of regular day workers, suffer from daytime sleepiness. 66% of men and 49% of women have driven while feeling drowsy, and 23% say they've fallen asleep at the wheel in the past year. 42% incorrectly believe that older people need fewer hours of sleep. Sleep needs remain unchanged as we age. 71% believe the body can successfully adjust to night shift work, but experts say the body never really adjusts because an internal biological clock governs when we are sleepy and alert. That clock is regulated by light and darkness. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The National Sleep Foundation is sponsoring National Sleep Day on April 2. Sleep specialists across the country will be offering brief, nondiagnostic consultations on sleep that day.

And --surprise -- one-third of adults suffered from significant daytime drowsiness.

Occupations that most often involve shift work, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, include protective services, like police and firefighters, food service, health care, trucking and transportation. A large share of teachers, nurses and accountants reported losing sleep because of job worries, according to a survey on American sleep habits taken by the furniture retailer Ikea. In addition to job stress, teachers may have trouble sleeping because long summer and holiday breaks tend to wreak havoc with their natural sleep patterns, while nurses may lose sleep because of rotating shift schedules, said Joyce A. Walsleben, director of New York University's Sleep Disorder Center. What can workers do to get more rest? Regular 20 minute naps in the afternoon would be a good start, advises Ms. Walsleben. And employers could help by creating more nap rooms; only 16 percent of workers were allowed to snooze at work last year.

Sleep researchers have long emphasized the importance of getting enough shut-eye for health and safety, and some cutting-edge research indicates that not getting enough sleep may promote weight gain, at least in the short term. Now this poll indicates sleep is crucial to good mood.

Other findings: * In general, 58% say they experience at least one symptom of insomnia at least a few nights a week.

"16290",16290," 愼㸰 Here is some advice for staying alert long after April 7, the day clocks spring forward one hour and most Americans lose an hour of sleep. ""if you're young, sleep an hour later on Sunday; if you're older, go to bed an hour early,"" suggests William C. Dement, director of Stanford (Calif.) University's Sleep Disorders Center and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. He is quick to point out that, for the 60,000,000 Americans who suffer from sleep debt, daylight-saving time isn't the culprit. ""If you're well rested, losing that one hour of sleep when daylight-saving time begins won't make a major difference. Don't worry about it,"" he maintains. However, most people incur a sleep debt because they don't get enough sleep over time, Dement says. ""A debt builds up if you sleep less than your personal need-from six to 10 hours a day, depending on individual variation-over the course of many nights. The good news is that you can repay the debt without interest. Someone who needs 10 hours of sleep could pay back a 10-hour debt over 10 days by sleeping one extra hour each night. You can catch up faster-for example, repaying six hours by sleeping 15 hours-though only actual sleep counts. Lying in bed and staring at the ceiling won't help repay the debt. 'To make the most of the time in bed, we recommend that older people go to bed early to pay back their debt or to make up for the hour on daylight-saving time. On the other hand, young people usually find it easier to sleep in later,"" Dement indicates. The reasons for the generation gap aren't clear, but research indicates that older people may react differently to darkness and light. 'The biological clock of older people tends to become set so that they feel sleepy sooner after dark than younger people,"" he suggests. Dement emphasizes that a single good night of sleep won't do much to help a seriously sleep-deprived person. A study conducted with long-distance truck drivers in the mid 1990s under simulated conditions showed that those who were seriously sleep-deprived were prone to doze off while driving even if they had eight hours of sleep three nights in succession before a long driving assignment. ""Their overall debt was too large to overcome in three nights."" How do you know when the debt is repaid? ""You'll feel it, Dement explains. ""You'll regain alertness and the feeling that extra sleep just won't make any difference anymore."" ",2002,"USA Today; Farmingdale"
"12708",12708," 愼㸰 Every Tuesday: Discoveries, breakthroughs and trends; See related stories: 06D One key to a good night's sleep, some researchers believe, is REM, or rapid eye movement sleep. REM sleep also is called paradoxial sleep because the brain is very active and more suggestive of being awake than being asleep, says sleep expert James Maas. During REM, when dreaming is most likely to occur, there is evidence that the brain stores some types of memory and learning. If you sleep a full eight hours, you have the best chance of getting four or five REM periods during the night. REM sleep occurs about every 90 minutes. As the night progresses, the REM periods get longer. The first REM period lasts about nine minutes; the second one, 20 minutes. The third period is about half an hour; the fourth, anywhere from one to two hours. To reach that long REM period, a person must sleep at least six to 61/2 hours a night, Maas says. Many researchers think it's the total length of time that matters, but Maas thinks that REM may make a big difference. ""We don't have conclusive evidence at this point, but it is probable that missing that long, last REM period can have detrimental effects on everything from daytime alertness to memory, concentration and even reaction time,"" he says.

"15059",15059," Wake up, Orange County! We doze at the wheel. We feel drowsy at meetings or school lectures. We lack the Energizer Bunny pep. We can't concentrate without that jolt of java. Sunday is the end of daylight-saving time, the perfect opportunity for the sleep-deprived to get back on track, experts say. Enjoying that hour of sleep we ""gain"" when we set our clocks back 60 minutes can be the beginning of slumber overhaul, said Dr. Paul Selecky, medical director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach. But we need to follow through with concrete changes in how we approach slumber to truly overcome sleep debt. Lily Chao will be among those who are looking forward to the extra hour of shut-eye. Most mornings when most of us are still in dreamland, Chao, 33, is awake at 4 a.m. An hour later, she opens the doors of Donut Star in West Irvine where she is a sales manager. She tries to get to sleep by 9 p.m. But once or twice a week, Chao won't climb into bed until 11 p.m. because she has chores at home or is taking care of her 3-month-old daughter. On days when she is sleep-deprived, she naps for an hour, maybe two, when she can get it in the afternoon. ""I sleep in ev ery chance that I get."" That chance doesn't happen often enough, she said. She pays a price for sleeping in, though -- it's tough getting up the next morning when she returns to her 4 a.m. routine. Why is it so tough? Because the body clock has to constantly adjust and adapt when we change our sleeping patterns, Selecky said. And while most Americans' popular habit of sleeping in on weekends may seem like a temporary solution, it does not address the real problem -- the need to adopt consistent and solid sleeping habits, he said. To understand and change our sleep habits, we need to look at our attitudes toward sleep, he said. Here are our problems: We don't know the value of sleep. We don't know exactly how much sleep we need. We mistakenly think we can achieve more if we sleep less. Underestimating sleep ""There are three pillars of good health: proper nutrition, regular exercise and sufficient amounts of quality sleep,"" Selecky said. Many know this but continue to treat sleep like Rodney Dangerfield: getting ""no respect."" Sleep experts estimate that most American adults need a minimum of eight hours of sleep a night to function properly. Yet, a National Sleep Foundation poll found that one-third of Americans 18 years and older sleep 6.5 hours or less nightly during the work week. About 45 percent said they sleep less in order to accomplish more. Sleep is such a basic powerful need that our minds and bodies at times will override our decision to stay awake. ""The need to sleep is as strong as the drive to breathe, to eat and to reproduce,"" said Dr. Peter Fotinakes, medical director at UCI Medical Center's Sleep Disorders Center. Think about those times when you drove your car on the freeway despite feeling extremely tired. You know that falling asleep at the wheel could cost you your life, yet you were unable to stop yourself from closing your eyes and dozing for a few seconds. How much is enough? Sometimes we don't get enough sleep because we don't realize how much we need. Although eight hours of sleep is the minimum most need, it's not a hard and fast rule. ""Every person's sleep needs are different,"" Fotinakes said. ""You have to listen to your body."" Here's how you can find out how much sleep you need, according to sleep specialist Dr. William Dement in his book ""The Promise of Sleep,"" (Dell Trade, $14.95): Let's say you think you need eight hours. Here's what to do: Pick a time when you think you can fall asleep easily. Set your alarm clock for eight hours and 15 minutes later. The 15 minutes is a rough estimate of the time it will take for you to fall asleep. Follow this routine for several days; observe and record in a sleep diary your level of alertness or sleepiness throughout the day. Keep track of your tendency to fall asleep while watching TV or reading a book. If you find that you are consistently sleepy and tired, you may need more sleep. Add 30 minutes to your sleep time and keep monitoring. If both your tendency to become drowsy and fall asleep declines, this means you are paying off your sleep debt. When your tendency to become drowsy and fall asleep stays the same, the amount of sleep you are getting is what you need or close to it. The price of not getting enough sleep In some circles, being able to get by on little sleep is often misconstrued as a superhuman ability -- something worth bragging about. Somehow, more waking hours translate into more hours for activity, particularly work. But we pay for that lack of sleep, especially at work. ""I need eight hours to feel my best the next day,"" said Chao, the doughnut-shop manager. ""Otherwise, I'm not as alert or quick to respond. I also get a little cranky sometimes."" At least two-thirds of adults say that sleepiness makes concentrating and handling stress on the job more difficult, according to the NSF poll. More than half say that decision-making and problem-solving are more difficult when they are sleepy. They say the quality and quantity of their work are diminished when they are sleepy. The negative effects of sleep debt hit shift workers the hardest, according to the poll. Driving while drowsy can be as hazardous as driving drunk, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association this year. One of Fotinakes' patients, a 19-year old man, fell asleep at the wheel, got into an accident and temporarily lost his license. He was thought to have narcolepsy, a sleep disorder in which people fall asleep at inappropriate times. But after an examination, Fotinakes found that the man had a severe case of sleep debt. ""He had a job, he went to college, he was volunteering at his church,"" Fotinakes said. ""His average day lasted probably 18 hours.""

"12425",12425," Scientists still know very little about what sleep really is, or what it accomplishes on a molecular level. Researchers reported in June that sleep helps rid the brain of a chemical called adenosine that builds up during wakeful hours, but no one knows why adenosine must be eliminated, or what other brain chemicals may contribute to the subjective feelings of sleepiness or mental exhaustion. How much sleep is enough? The answer varies from person to person. ""Some people can get by with 4 1/2 hours, and others really need nine,"" said Ronald Dahl, director of the child and adolescent sleep laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In addition, people differ in terms of the time of day in which they function best; some have no problem getting up early in the morning, while others are inexplicably but unquestionably night people and look upon dawn with Dracula-like dread. Sleep researchers refer to them as ""larks"" and ""owls."" Keeping those variations in mind, experts said, the following rules are generally true: * Full-term newborns need to sleep about two-thirds of the time, or about 18 hours a day. * Toddlers and young children need about 12 hours a day, some of which may be taken in naps. * Youngsters from about 8 up to the late teens need 8 1/4 to 9 1/4 hours of sleep a night, with older teens generally needing to fall asleep a little later and so needing to sleep a little longer in the morning. * Adults given the opportunity to sleep as much as they want in a laboratory setting that includes 14 hours of darkness each day often take the full 14 hours at first, then scale back, apparently having caught up with overdue sleep. Ultimately, they reach an equilibrium that includes about 8 1/4 hours of sleep each night. * Older adults typically get less sleep than that, perhaps because of an age-related decline in melatonin, the brain hormone that helps induce sleep. But it's not known whether they'd feel better if they got more than that. PHOTO: (Clock) Credit: THE WASHINGTON POST ",1997,"Los Angeles Times; Los Angeles, Calif."
"25053",25053," 愼㸰 Philadelphia -- At 8:30 a.m., a bleary-eyed young woman wearing a bright orange bandanna and fuzzy, gray slippers is staring at a computer screen. When a number appears in a small box, she hits the space bar. She does it again and again, sometimes quickly and other times much more slowly. ""She's very sleepy. She has a lot of lapses,"" whispers Namni Goel, a sleep researcher at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. The young woman, Amanda Burton, is taking a test of her attention and reaction speed. As a participant in a scientific study at the Sleep and Chronobiology Laboratory here, she has had just four hours of sleep each night for the past five nights. The Penn lab is one of the busiest human sleep research labs in the world. It has deprived more than 1,500 people of sleep over the decades with the goal of figuring out what happens in the bodies and brains of people when they skimp on shut-eye. It is an urgent question. Experts generally recommend that healthy adults sleep between seven and nine hours a night. But about 35% of adults say they typically get less than seven hours, according to a survey of 75,000 people conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2008. Chronic insufficient sleep has been linked to everything from diabetes and obesity to high blood pressure and an increased risk of death. ""We have to add sleep to this crazy world,"" says David F. Dinges, a professor in the department of psychiatry and the 66-year-old director of the Penn lab. ""And if we can't stop short sleeping, the question is: How do we optimize the ability to tolerate [sleep loss], what are the effects of this and how do we reverse it, stop it and alter it?"" On a recent Monday, Ms. Burton was one of three subjects living in the Penn sleep lab, a small, windowless space with linoleum floors and dim fluorescent lighting. The participants -- who are paid about $2,000 -- won't leave at all during the 14-day study. They can't exercise, use their phones or access the Internet. (Light and physical activity can affect sleep, mood and test performance. So can an argument with a significant other.) The study subjects are hooked up to wires that monitor their brain activity. They sleep -- the few hours they're allowed to -- in hospital beds in double rooms. Meals come from the hospital cafeteria. There's no caffeine, chocolate, nicotine or alcohol allowed. But there are unlimited snacks -- like Kind granola bars and spicy sweet chili Doritos -- available in the small kitchen. They are watched by technicians and ""minders"" (usually undergraduate employees) at all times -- except for bathroom breaks and showers. The monitors make sure study subjects are completing the various study tasks and staying awake when they're supposed to. ""Between 2 and 4 [a.m.] I was dozing off the entire time,"" says Ms. Burton, a 33-year-old administrative assistant from Plainfield, N.J., who is taking time off to participate in her third sleep study at Penn. The monitors ""had to constantly yell my name. 'Amanda, Amanda, hey, are you awake?' "" she says. This particular study of about 100 subjects, which Dr. Goel is leading, aims to see if people respond equally to two different types of sleep deprivation. It compares acute, total sleep loss (going 36 hours without sleep) with chronic sleep deprivation (in this case, just four hours of sleep between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. for five nights). Preliminary results indicate that the answer is yes, Dr. Goel says. ""There are huge individual differences. [But] if you are resilient to total sleep loss, you are resilient to being chronically sleep-deprived or if you're vulnerable to one, you are vulnerable to the other,"" she says. The study is also looking for genes and other so-called biomarkers -- substances in the blood -- that can predict which people are more vulnerable to the effects of sleep loss. Dr. Goel says the researchers expect to finish the study later this year. About every two hours, the study subjects complete a battery of tests that measure things like attention and reaction time, working memory and how quickly they can process information. They complete questionnaires that ask about mood and how sleepy they feel. Researchers calculate the number of calories they eat. In earlier studies, the Penn lab and others have found that attention, reaction time and cognitive speed tend to be particularly affected by sleep loss. This is a big problem for driving. Higher cognitive functions, like reasoning, tend to be less affected. Mood plummets: People interpret even neutral facial expressions as more negative. Sleep-deprived subjects also eat more and gain weight: In Penn studies, they eat about 500 extra calories a day, veer toward fat-laden foods and gain about 2 pounds in a week. Most Penn sleep-deprivation studies include a control group that lives in the same environment and does the same testing protocol, but doesn't lose any sleep. But not everyone tolerates sleep loss the same: In general about one-third of people are resistant to the effects of sleep loss, one-third are vulnerable and one-third are somewhere in the middle, Dr. Dinges says. Ms. Burton seems to fall into the vulnerable group, Dr. Goel says. On the test where she had to hit the space bar when the number appeared, dubbed the psychomotor vigilance test or PVT, it took Ms. Burton sometimes as long as 2 seconds to react accurately. By contrast, another subject, Daniel Dougherty, usually took less than 300 milliseconds to respond. A typical, well-rested person would need about 250 milliseconds. Other studies have shown that most people aren't good judges of how sleepy -- and how impaired -- they are. ""I was like, that will be a breeze,"" says Mr. Dougherty, a 32-year-old from Goldsboro, Md., of what he expected the study to be like. ""But it is actually kind of hard. Just feeling tired and wanting to go to sleep but you can't."" Mr. Doughtery is changing careers and plans to use the sleep study money to repair his 15 year-old car. Between tests the study subjects read, watch TV and play board games. There's an entire bookcase filled with games like Monopoly, Sorry and Pictionary. They binge-watch shows on Netflix. Ms. Burton got through five seasons of ""Portlandia."" Mr. Dougherty was plowing through ""Narcos"" episodes. Researchers decided that TV-watching would be acceptable because the subjects sit far enough from the televisions that the light emitted wouldn't interfere with the results. The study is being funded by the Office of Naval Research. Dr. Dinges has also just completed a study looking at how long it takes to recover from sleep deprivation. In earlier studies, it seemed to only take a few days of regular shut-eye for people to recover from sleep loss and perform like they were well-rested. But this new study seems to refute that. People might seem fine, but if they lose sleep again, their performance plummets more than expected. ""There's a memory in this biology,"" Dr. Dinges says. ""They are carrying a vulnerability."" If the results hold up and are replicated, he says, the days of human sleep-deprivation studies might be numbered. ""If I can't reverse what I've induced, then these experiments are no longer ethical,"" he says. ""I've got to stop doing this.""

"21401",21401," 愼㸰 Americans who log long hours on the job find the time for leisure and other activities by cutting down on sleep, a study reports today. ""We only have 24 hours in a day,"" says Mathias Basner, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. His study of 47,731 Americans found that people who worked more simply got up earlier or went to bed later -- a practice that puts them at risk of sleep deprivation. Time spent at work is the single biggest determinant of how much sleep Americans got on a typical day, according to the study in the Sept. 1 issue of the journal Sleep. But travel time, including time sitting in traffic on the way to work, comes in second place, Basner says. ""You could argue there's a hidden cost to living in suburbia,"" says Gregory Belenky, director of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University in Spokane. People who live in sprawling urban areas often make a long workday even longer when they try to run errands on clogged roads, he says. Basner says sleep deprivation has been linked to a number of serious health problems, including obesity. People who are chronically sleep-deprived also can experience attention lapses, memory loss and other difficulties that can impair performance on the job, says James Walsh, executive director of the sleep medicine and research center at St. Luke's Hospital in St. Louis. And fatigue can add an element of danger to an already stressful commute. ""If you're only sleeping five hours a night, you're at risk of falling asleep at the wheel,"" Walsh says. The National Sleep Foundation estimates that sleep-deprived drivers cause more than 100,000 automobile crashes a year and more than 1,500 deaths. Basner's team analyzed the results of a federal survey conducted in 2003 through 2005. People were asked to account for their time over a 24-hour period. The survey suggests that people who cut back on sleep on weekdays often try to sleep in on Saturday and Sunday. But people who cut back on sleep night after night might never catch up, Walsh says. Surveys suggest Americans get about 6 1/2 hours of sleep a night - - about an hour less than the average in the 1950s, he says. Today, many adults extend their workdays by using cellphones to check e- mail messages. A second study in Sleep suggests that teens who use cellphones after lights out can have daytime sleepiness. The teens in this study lived in Europe, but teens in the USA also use cellphones to text-message and chat with friends at all hours, says Amy Wolfson of the National Sleep Foundation. ""We're living in a 24/7 culture, and teens are mimicking adults,"" she says. Says Walsh: ""People feel that sleep is negotiable."" Yet studies suggest that most adults need from seven to eight hours of sleep a night, and teens need nine hours or more in order to do their best during the day, he says.

"20024",20024," America is raising a nation of sleep-deprived kids, with only 20 percent getting the recommended nine hours of shuteye on school nights and more than 1 in 4 reporting dozing off in class. Many are arriving late to school because of oversleeping and others are driving drowsy, according to a poll released Tuesday by the National Sleep Foundation. ""In the competition between the natural tendency to stay up late and early school start times, a teen's sleep is what loses out,"" said Jodi Mindell of St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. ""Sending students to school without enough sleep is like sending them to school without breakfast,"" said Mindell, associate director of the Sleep Center at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. School-age children and teenagers should get at least nine hours of sleep a day, according to the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research at the National Institutes of Health. The poll found that 6th graders were sleeping an average of 8.4 hours on school nights and 12th graders just 6.9 hours. Without enough sleep, a person has trouble focusing and responding quickly, according to the NIH. The poll, taken in November, interviewed 1,602 adult caregivers and their children age 11 to 17. It had a margin of error of 2.4 percentage points. Among the findings: 28 percent of high school students said they fell asleep in class at least once a week. Four-fifths of students who get the recommended amount of sleep are achieving A's and B's in school. According to the NIH, sleep needs vary from person to person and change throughout life. For example, children in preschool sleep between 10 hours and 12 hours a day; school-age children and teenagers should get at least nine hours of sleep a day. Adults should get seven hours to eight hours of sleep each day. The National Sleep Foundation describes itself as an independent non-profit organization. It is funded by memberships, sales of educational materials, advertising, investment income, donations, subscriptions, and educational grants from foundations, federal agencies and corporations, including pharmaceutical companies.

"14378",14378," ''You must sleep sometime between lunch and dinner, and no halfway measures. Take off your clothes and get into bed. That's what I always do. Don't think you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day. That's a foolish notion held by people who have no imaginations. You will be able to accomplish more. You get two days in one -- well, at least one and a half.''Winston Churchill  As a short sleeper who is rarely in bed for more than six hours a night, I'm a strong believer in naps for recharging my batteries. Sir Winston and I are in good company. Napping enthusiasts have included Albert Einstein, Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas Edison and at least three presidents: John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Besides, sleep researchers have shown that regardless of how long one sleeps at night, the human body is programmed to become sleepy in the early afternoon, even without a big lunch. ''Napping should not be frowned upon at the office or make you feel guilty at home,'' writes Dr. James B. Maas, a psychologist and sleep expert at Cornell. ''It should have the status of daily exercise.'' In the old days, people would doze for an hour or so after the midday meal, and in some Latin American and European countries siestas are still in vogue. But in most industrialized nations, the usual response to the afternoon sag in energy is to try to jump-start the system with caffeine, a tactic that sleep experts say is actually counterproductive, creating only the illusion of efficiency and alertness and depriving the body and brain of much-needed sleep. How Naps Help Now, however, there is growing evidence that restorative naps are making a comeback. Recognizing that most of their employees are chronically sleep-deprived, some companies have set up nap rooms with reclining chairs, blankets and alarm clocks. If unions are truly interested in worker welfare, they should make such accommodations a standard item in contract negotiations. Workers who take advantage of the opportunity to sleep for 20 minutes or so during the workday report that they can then go back to work with renewed enthusiasm and energy. My college roommate, Dr. Linda Himot, a psychiatrist in Pittsburgh, who has a talent for 10-minute catnaps between patients, says these respites help her focus better on each patient's problems, which are not always scintillating. And companies that encourage napping report that it reduces accidents and errors and increases productivity, even if it shortens the workday a bit. Studies have shown that sleepy workers make more mistakes and cause more accidents, and are more susceptible to heart attacks and gastrointestinal disorders. A NASA scientist's study showed that 24-minute naps significantly improved a pilot's alertness and performance on trans-Atlantic flights. (The co-pilot remained awake.) Dr. David Dinges, a sleep researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, is a strong advocate of prophylactic napping -- taking what he and others call a ''power nap'' during the day to head off the cumulative effects of sleep loss. He explained that the brain ''sort of sputters'' when it is deprived of sufficient sleep, causing slips in performance and attentiveness and often resulting in ''microsleeps'' -- involuntary lapses into sleep, in which accidents can occur. A brief afternoon nap typically leaves people feeling more energized than if they had tried to muddle through without sleeping. Studies have shown that the brain is more active in people who nap than in those who don't sleep during the day. Dr. Maas, the Cornell psychologist and author of ''Power Sleep'' (Villard Books, 1998), points out that naps ''greatly strengthen the ability to pay close attention to details and to make critical decisions.'' He also states that ''naps taken about eight hours after you wake have been proved to do much more for you than if you added those 20 minutes onto already adequate nocturnal sleep.'' There are two kinds of naps: brief ones taken to revive the brain and long ones taken to compensate for significant sleep loss. The reviving workday nap should not be longer than 30 minutes; any more and the body lapses into a deep sleep, from which it is difficult to awake. How and When to Nap Long naps help when you've accumulated a considerable sleep debt -- for example, when the previous night's sleep was much shorter than usual, or when you know you will have to be alert and awake considerably later than your usual bedtime. I usually try to nap for an hour or more before attending a play, concert or late party. But long naps have a temporary disadvantage: they cause what researchers call sleep inertia, a grogginess upon awakening that can last about half an hour. Also, long naps can affect the body's clock, making it more difficult to wake up at the proper time in the morning. As Dr. Maas maintains, ''Brief naps taken daily are far healthier than sleeping in or taking very long naps on the weekend.'' They are also far better than caffeine as a pick-me-up. ''Consumption of caffeine will be followed by feelings of lethargy and reduced R.E.M. (or dream) sleep that night,'' Dr. Maas writes. ''A debt in your sleep bank account is not reduced by artificial stimulants.'' He suggests that naps be scheduled for midday because late-afternoon naps can cause a shift in your biological clock, making it harder to fall asleep at night and get up the next morning. To keep naps short -- 15 to 30 minutes, set an alarm clock or timer. Westclox makes a gadget called Napmate, a power-nap alarm clock that has a one-button preset so you can program your nap to last for a specific number of minutes. If you can lie down on a couch or bed, all the better. If not, use a reclining chair. You need not follow Churchill's advice to get undressed, but make yourself as comfortable as possible. Lap robes are very popular and inexpensive; if a blanket helps you to doze off, use one. Try to take your nap about the same time each day. Dr. Maas recommends a nap eight hours after you wake up (in the middle of your day, about eight hours before you go to bed at night). Even on days when you don't feel particularly sleepy, he suggests taking a rest rather than a coffee break at your usual nap time. There are special cases. People who have trouble falling asleep at night might be wise to avoid daytime naps. Parents of newborns should nap when the baby does, rather than using all the baby's sleep time to do chores. Finally, naps are often essential for people trying to work through illness, injury or chemotherapy, even if they get adequate sleep at night. A woman I know who continued working while receiving cancer therapy napped each day on the floor under her desk. Like so many workplaces, hers had no suitable place to rest.

"9458",9458," One friend tells me he needs at least eight hours of sleep each night to avoid feeling ""dead tired"" the next day. Another says that if she gets more than six hours a night she wakes up ""feeling like a lead balloon."" How do you know how much sleep is the right amount, and how can you adjust your sleep schedule if you fail to get enough sleep now and then, or night after night? Researchers have a fancy way of judging how sleepy a person is at various times of the day and night. Called the multiple sleep-latency test, it involves an assessment in a sleep lab of how long it takes a person to fall asleep at two-hour intervals. Such studies show that people generally have two especially sleepy times: at what most people think of as bedtime, around 10 p.m. to midnight, and in midafternoon, around 2 to 4 p.m. They also show that a fully rested person will not fall asleep within 20 minutes at any test session during the day, whereas a sleep-deprived person will fall asleep in three or four minutes at every session, just as do people with the sleep disorders narcolepsy and sleep apnea. And when people who are sleep-deprived live in a sleep laboratory, without any cues about day and night or alarm to arouse them, they will often sleep for as many as 16 out of every 24 hours for days on end until they ""catch up"" on lost sleep and gradually revert to a more normal sleep period of about eight hours. Dr. James Maas, a psychology professor and sleep researcher at Cornell University, suggests this self-test: ""If a warm room, heavy meal, boring lecture or meeting or a low dose of alcohol make you drowsy, you are sleep-deprived. A well-rested person will become bored, annoyed, restless or fidgety, but not sleepy, under such circumstances."" Furthermore, he said, on going to bed at night, a well-rested person will take 10 to 15 minutes to fall asleep, but a sleep-deprived person will fall asleep within a few minutes. Experts estimate that 100 million Americans maintain a serious sleep debt by failing, night after night, to get enough sleep. They also say that most sleep-deprived people do not realize just how prone they really are to falling asleep at the drop of a hat. In a study by Dr. Thomas Roth at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, 100 young adults were given a multiple sleep-latency test. Thirty-four percent of those who said they never got sleepy during the day performed like a person with sleep apnea. Maas, who produced ""Sleep Alert,"" a film on sleep deprivation for public television, gives these guidelines for good sleep hygiene: - Know how much sleep you need. Most people get only seven hours of sleep each night but need eight to eight and a half hours. If you are sleepy during the day, you are not sleeping enough at night. - Try to sleep in a continuous block. People need a long period of consolidated sleep; sleep broken by frequent awakenings leaves people unrested no matter how long they spend in bed. - Go to sleep at the same time every night and wake up at the same time each morning. ""You should never need an alarm clock to wake up,"" Maas insists, unless, of course, you have to catch a very early flight. And trying to catch up on sleep by sleeping late the next morning merely messes up your body's normal sleep-wake rhythm. - Remember that sleep loss is cumulative. ""If you take sleep out of the bank for one or two nights, be sure to pay it back as soon as possible so that your week's sleep total is always stable,"" Maas said. - Get daily physical exercise, which results in more restful deep sleep and also decreases your total sleep need a little. But Maas cautioned against exercising within three hours of bedtime, because exercise increases alertness and inhibits the ability to fall asleep. He said the best time to exercise to induce restful sleep was between noon and 6 p.m. If you have frequent or periodic insomnia, as one-third of people do on any given night, take a hot bath before bed, read a book for pleasure, write your worries down and leave your notes on the nightstand, and be sure your bedroom is quiet, dark and cool. Do not use caffeine or other stimulants to counter midday sleepiness. Although stimulants produce momentary feelings of alertness, they rob people of restful REM, or dream, sleep at night. To readjust a sleep schedule that is causing a chronic sleep debt, start going to bed 15 to 20 minutes earlier each week. It may take six or eight weeks to reschedule your bedtime so that you avoid daytime sleepiness. Instead of a coffee break or as part of your lunch hour, Maas suggests a ""nap break."" He said, ""A 15- to 20-minute nap will increase alertness, productivity and creativity."" In anticipation of a late night or short night, take a nap beforehand to help prevent sleepiness the next day.

"15175",15175," Q.: Why am I so sleepy and drowsy after lunch? It makes it hard to concentrate. A.: There are three likely explanations, based on recent research. First, what do you eat -- and drink? A lunch high in carbohydrates, especially if no protein is eaten along with bread and milk, is likely to produce calm to the point of sleepiness, because of the complex role of carbohydrates in shifting the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain. Conversely, some protein contributes to alertness. A three-martini lunch also induces sleepiness. Second, as siesta-loving societies have long recognized, sleep researchers have found that there is an inborn readiness in human beings to take a midafternoon nap. Volunteers isolated from all evidence of day and night and left to set their own sleep patterns tended to settle into one long sleep session and a session of 1 or 2 hours about 12 hours after the middle of the main period. Third, you may be sleep-deprived. While the average adult needs eight to nine hours of sleep a night, most get only seven, and many get six or less during the workweek. People permitted to sleep as much as they choose sleep 10.3 hours out of every 24, just as monkeys and apes do. An afternoon nap may be just what nature ordered to restore alertness. C.

"23343",23343," THE FACTS Poor sleep and advancing age go hand in hand - at least, that is the conventional wisdom. But growing research suggests that getting older may not necessarily mean getting less sleep. Scientists suspect that sleep problems in many older Americans may be a symptom of underlying illness, not simply aging. In a study published this month in the journal Sleep, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania looked at nearly 156,000 people, focusing on how well they slept at night and how often they experienced fatigue. The researchers found that poor general health and depression were linked to sleep disturbances and tiredness. Looking at reports of sleep problems across all ages, the researchers also found a slight increase in sleep disturbances during middle age. But over all, most people reported fewer sleep problems as they grew older, and 80-year-old people had fewer complaints than those who were 50. Another study last year showed that older people had a better ability to withstand the effects of sleep deprivation. And a large analysis of studies involving people of all ages found that most changes in sleep patterns occured between the ages of 20 and 60, and that healthy older people did not have more trouble falling asleep than younger counterparts. Those who do experience sleep problems, the study's authors said, may be showing signs of illness or side effects of medication, and should talk to a doctor. THE BOTTOM LINE In healthy adults, sleep does not necessarily get worse with age. scitimes@nytimes.comnThis is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

"25698",25698," Baseball is a game of numbers. But the most important number this season is not Ryan Zimmerman's .347 batting average, Aaron Judge's 24 home runs or Clayton Kershaw's 10 wins and 2.61 earned-run average as of Tuesday. The most important number in baseball for the 2017 season is 3:08. That's three hours and eight minutes, the average time it takes to play a Major League Baseball (MLB) game, according to Baseball-Reference.com. It's an important number because it is way too slow. In fact, MLB games are being played at the slowest pace in history. In 2000, the average game was 3:01 - not that big a difference. But in 1980, the average game was finished in two hours and 38 minutes. These numbers are important because baseball is losing fans, and especially young fans, to faster games such as basketball, soccer and lacrosse. So what can MLB do to speed things up? Here are some ideas. Stay in the box: Too many players step out of the batter's box after every pitch to adjust their batting gloves and take practice swings. Years ago, there was a player named Mike Hargrove, who adjusted his gloves so often they called him ""the Human Rain Delay."" Now, almost every player is like Mike Hargrove. The rule should be: Stay in the batter's box. Stop fiddling around, and play ball. Fewer meetings: It seems that every inning is interrupted with meetings on the pitcher's mound. Catchers, infielders, pitching coaches and managers come out to talk. Meetings are often boring, but they are really boring in baseball. I think the rules should limit meetings on the mound to one an inning. If you want to talk with the pitcher or another player, yell or use signals. Signals are cool. They are baseball's secret language. Instant-replay review: I don't like instant-replay review because it sends the message to kids that every call has to be perfect for the game to be fair. Sometimes there are going to be bad calls. It's good to learn to ignore them and keep playing hard. If we are going to have replay review, at least speed it up. If the manager thinks the call was wrong, he should protest right away - within 10 seconds. That would cut down on the number of protests because a manager who challenges and is wrong gets no more challenges in a regular-season game. Pitching changes: Some have suggested that MLB make rules to limit the number of pitchers who can pitch in an inning. Or have a clock so pitchers must throw a pitch within 20 seconds. These are pretty radical suggestions. But MLB has to do something because 3:08 is a bad number for baseball. kidspost@washpost.com Bowen writes the sports opinion column for KidsPost.

Teenagers generally require more than nine hours of sleep to remain alert. * The average sleeper moves 30 times in eight hours. * In older age, people tend to sleep less during the night and doze off during the day. Contrary to common belief, the need for sleep does not decrease with age--the elderly find that their sleep just becomes more fitful. * On average, working mothers with children sleep five percent less each night than their husbands. * It takes 10-15 minutes for well-rested people to fall asleep. * Couples who share a bed sleep less deeply. * More than 40,000,000 Americans snore. Loud snoring measures 80 decibels, equivalent to the sound of a jackhammer. Men are nine times more likely to snore than women. * Eight out of 10 asthma sufferers with nighttime symptoms awake an average of three nights per week. Those who experience symptoms of nocturnal asthma wake up an average of twice a night, and more than half stay awake 30 minutes at a time. * In a study conducted by the Sleep Disorders Center at Stanford University's Medical School, more than half of all shift workers surveyed admit that they fall asleep at work on a regular basis. * Charles Dickens would sleep only in a bed that was aligned on a north-south axis. * Benjamin Franklin slept in two beds each night, moving to the second when the first became too warm for him. * During World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stayed rested and alert by scheduling cabinet meetings around his naps. * During the final 48 hours of his 1992 run for the presidency, Bill Clinton campaigned through 14 cities and 5,000 miles without sleep.

"14596",14596," Americans are sleeping less to cram in more work and play, a self- defeating cycle that leaves half the work force complaining that drowsiness interferes with their job, researchers said Tuesday. The National Sleep Foundation said adults of all ages get less than the recommended eight hours of sleep a night, putting themselves at risk of auto accidents and, over the longer-term, greater risk of diseases such as high blood pressure and diabetes. The foundation released its ""Sleep in America"" poll that found a third of adults slept only 6.5 hours a night during the work week. People got more sleep on weekends but still not eight hours. The poll of 1,154 adults found 45 percent of respondents will sleep less in order to get more work done. Surfing the Internet and watching television are also seen as prime contributors to the lack of sleep. Those activities were blamed by 43 percent for staying up late. ""Sleep is viewed as expendable,"" said James Walsh, a vice president of the foundation and executive director of St. Luke's Hospital Sleep Medicine/Research Center, in Chesterfield, Missouri. ""The people who stay up to work, they work more, but it's probably the same people who complain they can't concentrate the next day,"" Walsh said at a press conference. Fifty-one percent said sleepiness on the job interferes with the amount of work they get done and nearly one in five adults reported making work errors due to drowsiness. National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall said sleep problems permeated society. He said operator fatigue had been on the agency's priority list of safety improvements for over a decade. ""Human fatigue is one of the most endemic safety issues in our society,"" said Hall, who recounted the death of a friend's son when he fell asleep at the wheel of his pickup truck. Half of the poll's respondents admitted to driving while drowsy. Among 18 to 29-year-olds, 24 percent reported falling asleep at the wheel at some point during the past year.

Catching some Z's at the office might seem like the worst thing to do when you're behind, but napping can improve productivity, according to sleep scientist Sara Mednick, a professor at the University of California-San Diego and author of ""Take a Nap! Change Your Life."" That daily 20-minute run to the coffeehouse would be better spent either catching up on missed sleep or supplementing the eight hours you got the night before. Research shows performance on memory tasks improves more following a nap than after a dose of caffeine, which provides only a short-term buzz, Mednick said. ""Most people are not sleeping well,"" she said. ""The average is about 6.7 hours a night."" Well-rested employees get along better with co-workers and feel more energized at the day's end, plus sleep better at night, Mednick said. But don't count too many sheep while you're on the clock.

"11825",11825," Sleep Thieves: An Eye-Opening Exploration Into the Science and Mysteries of Sleep By Stanley Coren Free Press, 303 pages, $24 The Enchanted World of Sleep By Pertz Lavie, translated by Anthony Berris Yale University Press, 270 pages, $27.50 They say we know more about the moons of Jupiter than we do about the ocean depths; surely for most of us the depths of sleep are equally remote. Scientists know much about sleep, but unlike, say, the facts of exercise or nutrition, the facts have not reached the laity. This was apparent from a reading of these two fascinating books, which explain the state of the art in sleep research and its implications for everyday life. Stanley Coren's is more accessible and brightly written, although Pertz Lavie is a fine writer as well, and he gives considerable detail from his own research, including many charts and graphs. A professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia, Coren enumerates the things that rob us of sleep and describes the serious consequences. The first thief is our Western cultural disapproval of sleep, what Coren calls ""Edison's Curse"": We, along with the inventor of the lightbulb, regard sleep as time wasted and admire anyone who gets by with less than we do, and we constantly try to fit more activity into our day by truncating our sleeping hours. But if we need 7 1/2 hours of sleep a night and we get only 6, a sleep debt builds up that, over several days, makes us depressed, forgetful, inefficient, accident-prone and downright stupid. Fortunately, we can make up sleep debt in one or two nights, and many adults do that on weekends, but sleep-deprived teenagers tend to sleep even less on weekends. Teens indeed are as severely affected by sleep debt as adults, and much failure in school, Coren writes, is because of sleep deprivation or a mismatch between school hours and the sleep-clocks of individual kids. Puberty often brings, for a few years at least, a night-owl cycle where one is brightest and sharpest at night and unable to function in early morning. But the high school bus comes at 7. It is not boredom or the droning engine that makes us drowsy while driving; it's sleep debt. Here Coren cites research by Lavie (head of the Sleep Laboratory at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel) and others that shows most people have two periods of strongest sleep-need per day: in the predawn hours and the late afternoon. Natural sleepiness at these times is made worse by sleep debt. In ""The Enchanted World of Sleep,"" Lavie reports his findings that from 1984 to 1989 in Israel, accidents caused by falling asleep at the wheel peaked between 3 and 6 a.m. and 3 and 6 p.m. Other perhaps surprising facts from ""Sleep Thieves"": It can take as many as six hours to clear sleep-inhibiting caffeine from the body. Alcohol makes you drowsy and helps you fall asleep, but it impairs rapid-eye-movement sleep later in the night, often depriving you of real rest. The same is true of strenuous exercise in the evening hours. Uncomfortable conditions (too much light, a too-soft or too-hard mattress) or even minor interruptions can be the equivalent of lost hours. ",1996,"Chicago Tribune (pre-1997 Fulltext); Chicago, Ill."
"16015",16015," If you're like most people who don't get enough sleep during the week, you used the luxury of an extra 60 minutes Sunday for catching zzz's. For some people, sleep is sacrificed when lives are crammed with activity. If you've been feeling tired and less energetic playing your sport or exercising, look at the amount and quality of sleep you're getting. Think of sleep as the time your body needs to make repairs -- you let the engine literally cool down. Athletic trainers recognize this. Any training plan should include recovery, says a report from the American College of Sports Medicine. Athletes in training need at least six to eight hours of deep sleep every night. Sleep deficits can significantly impede training. You might feel less energetic, sluggish, tired, cranky, less able to concentrate or focus. Sleep deficit can be a one-time occurrence -- getting five hours instead of your usual eight. You can accumulate sleep deficit -- when you get only six or seven hours on weeknights instead of the eight or nine your body and mind want. The amount of sleep an athlete needs is personal -- it varies from one person to the next. Remember that just because you need eight or more hours doesn't mean you're weaker than the person who functions on six. The quality of your sleep also is important. The kind that rejuvenates the body often occurs in the later stages of sleep -- called deep sleep and R.E.M. (rapid eye movement) sleep, Dr. Gary Zammit writes in ""Good Nights"" (Andrews and McMeel, $22.95). Sleep occurs in a cycle that repeats throughout the night. You go from light sleep to deep and R.E.M. sleep and then start over with light sleep. But you may not get enough deep and R.E.M. sleep because something interrupts your sleep -- though not enough to wake you. That interruption can be caused by snoring, sudden noises, a sleep disorder called sleep apnea, pain and many other things. If you're getting adequate amounts but not sleeping deeply enough, your body may not be getting enough repair time. How can you tell if you've had sufficient quality sleep? You awake feeling rested and rejuvenated, and sustain this feeling throughout your waking hours. Sometimes your ability to fall asleep is affected by when you exercise. Physicians specializing in sleep disorders suggest not exercising vigorously or playing sports less than three hours before you go to sleep. Light stretching and breathing exercises are OK. Most people who work out close to bedtime may experience difficulty nodding off and staying asleep because exercise can increase feelings of alertness. On the other hand, others are able to sleep without trouble after a workout. Liddane is an American Council on Exercise-certified group fitness instructor.

"22572",22572," ""Celebrity Autobiography,"" a popular comedy show with a rotating cast of performers who read directly from works by famous people, involves a simple setup: mainly microphones and a chair or two. ""I feel like a monkey could do it,"" jokes Rachel Dratch, a ""Saturday Night Live"" alum and frequent performer. The cabaret-style show runs usually once a month in a 135-seat New York theater. It will soon tour Chicago, Pittsburgh, Austin, Texas, and Los Angeles, where it started a decade ago, says the show's creator, Eugene Pack. Mr. Pack calls the show ""found comedy,"" humor mined from celebrities' (or ghostwriters') own words. Stars' life philosophies have a way of sounding absurd in the presence of a crowd with a two-drink minimum. The readings also find a joke in the pairing of performer with material. For instance, former TV host Dick Cavett recently delivered a deadpan reading from a Jonas Brothers tour book. Mr. Pack says the show is meant to be fun, not mockery. He estimates he has culled through nearly 300 books to come up with the roughly 100 now in rotation, including material from Ivana Trump, Madonna and Burt Reynolds. Performers have included actors Rita Wilson, Kristen Wiig and Ryan Reynolds. On a recent evening, Megan Mullally, of ""Will & Grace,"" read with daffy sincerity from Zsa Zsa Gabor's 1991 memoir, ""One Lifetime Is Not Enough."" Ms. Mullally started with Ms. Gabor's description of her 72 hours in prison after her arrest for slapping a police officer: ""I realize that, for the first time since I am a child, I -- who normally sleep naked except for diamond earrings -- am not wearing them."" To craft a cohesive stage piece, Mr. Pack may pull lines from different parts of a memoir. (Books by today's media-savvy stars can be more challenging to adapt than the self-serious ones from the past.) Mr. Pack says no celebrity has ever complained to him about being used in the show, and he knows of only one author, ""Star Trek"" actor George Takei, who has attended a performance. Mr. Takei says he didn't write the passage about running naked from the shower to take a life-changing call from his agent for laughs, but so be it.

"8371",8371," 愼㸰 He was an office worker at the telephone company, but when colleagues came to call they often would catch him napping. One day some of them drew a cartoon of him, snoring away, and pinned it on his door. Everyone thought it was hilarious-except the napper. ""He was just sleepy,"" said his doctor, Allan Pack, director of the Center for Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology at the University of Pennsylvania. Nappers-in our culture, anyway-get no respect. The afternoon nap may be a time-honored tradition in warm-weather countries, but try taking one here and co-workers will conclude you're sick, you've had a little too much vino with lunch or you're just lazy. Napping ""is not viewed as an acceptable adult daytime activity in our culture,"" said Rochelle Goldberg, clinical director of the Sleep Disorders Center of the Medical College of Pennsylvania. But new research indicates the nap may be a lot more valuable than anybody thought-in fact, it may be a great way to catch up on lost sleep. If there were such a thing as the Nap Commission, it would no doubt be headed by David Dinges, a biological psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a 1989 book with the intimidating title ""Sleep and Alertness-Chronobiological, Behavioral and Medical Aspects of Napping."" ""There is an inherent napping tendency in all of us,"" said Dinges, a man who sprinkles his conversation with terms such as ""compensatory napping"" (napping to make up for nighttime sleep missed), ""prophylactic napping"" (napping done before an anticipated sleep deficit) and ""appetitive napping"" (napping even when you don't feel tired). A book about taking a nap? Surprise-napping is a hot topic these days. There are at the moment at least eight books on the shelves dealing with napping, ranging from Dinges' scientific essay to explorations of the ""power nap"" and a look at Winston Churchill's napping habits. This was not always so. Napping, according to Dinges, was ""for many years a backwater"" (and a sleepy one, no doubt), even among researchers of sleep disorders. ""Even a lot of sleep doctors didn't think napping was appropriate,"" he said. ""But a number of us have been studying it for the last decade, and it appears this is changing."" Not that Dinges says napping is a panacea for all our problems. In fact, he says, it's been oversold (by proponents of such things as ""power napping"") as well as overcondemned (by most bosses). But he does say it has its place. Research on napping is opening some eyes these days, partly because of the findings of the National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research, released earlier this year. The commission found that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep disorders and that the consequences ""span all aspects of modern society""-and cost the country at least $15.9 billion in 1990. ""This is a very sleepy country,"" said June Fry, director of the Sleep Disorders Center of the Medical College of Pennsylvania. ""There is a tremendous amount of sleep deprivation, and people don't take sleep very seriously."" And if you think the situation is getting better-dream on. ""The fact that some cultures have a lot of napping and others don't doesn't mean it isn't biologically driven,"" Dinges said. ""When a society moves from being primarily agrarian to industrial, the government typically does two things. . . . No more siestas, and shift work."" Enter the nap. ""It's a way to get a person through a rough period,"" Goldberg said. ""It can be a way of catching up on your sleep debt."" Don't get them wrong-every expert still says a good night's sleep is the ideal solution. But if for some reason that seven to eight hours of slumber eludes you, ""it's better to take a nap than not to,"" Fry says. In fact, since afternoon napping tends to be rich in the most restful phase of slow-wave sleep, in which brain activity slows to a crawl, it's a particularly effective tool for catching up on lost slumber. Experts say a short afternoon nap actually leaves you ""more"" rested than the same amount of time tacked onto your morning sleep. Dinges studied naps as a tool to get through a period of reduced sleep. Surprisingly, he found that if you're facing such a period, taking a nap before that time seems more effective than making up the sleep later. Dinges believes some people in particular might benefit from a nap now and then. He targets people ""whose performance affects the lives and safety of others,"" people in occupations ""where the nature of the work involves passive vigilance"" and people who work ""where there is a safety system which would allow them to take a nap."" On the other hand, certain people probably won't find napping a help. Among them: people who suffer from sleep apnea (a disorder in which the victim stops breathing numerous times during the night) and those who suffer from insomnia. For the latter group, napping pushes the sleep cycle even further out of whack. The average nap lasts 70 minutes, according to Dinges. But he advises not letting it go on more than two hours. ""If you sleep more than two hours, you risk delaying your sleep that night,"" he said. Older people, he added, should keep their naps to less than an hour.

"20864",20864," POP FITNESS An afternoon snooze refreshes, revitalizes, recharges body and soul. Yet in our caffeine-buzzed society, naps are downright un- American. Slamming Red Bull, chugging Starbucks coffee and draining quad- shots of espresso is a lot more socially acceptable as the ""cure"" for sleep debt. Besides, it's tough to nap with all that caffeine rocketing through the aorta. And remember, if you snooze, you lose, right? Not according to scientific research. The rejuvenating effects of naps has resurfaced in a recent Stanford University School of Medicine study. Emergency room doctors and nurses who worked overnight shifts and were allowed 40-minute naps showed a boost in alertness and performance over those who worked straight through. Which group of doctors would you prefer probing your abdomen for a 38-caliber slug? ""Napping is a very powerful, very inexpensive way of improving our work,"" said Dr. Steven Howard, one of the study's authors. Research by Cornell University's James Maas, who is credited with coining the term ""power nap,"" revealed that nearly four in 10 American workers admit napping on the job, snoozing in bathroom stalls, at their desks (under them too) or in their cars. Convincing bosses that productivity improves with a nap hasn't met with success. Despite being supported by medical studies, the benefit of naps has been ignored for the illusion of an indefatigable workforce. In the 1990s, the 20-minute power nap stirred corporate America, but it was just a ripple. Sleeping on the job with the boss' blessing remains a rare perk. ""Slackers or an old person,"" said lifelong napper Karen Calhoun, 39, of Elk Grove, Calif., offering her take on America's opinion of nappers. The Starbucks phenomenon also began brewing in the 1990s. Why take a nap when you can sip your way to consciousness? ""We drive ourselves too hard,"" said Jill Murphy Long, a dedicated napper and author of ""Permission to Nap."" ""How many people are on Prozac and Zoloft? There's a better way to go about it than taking chemicals."" Her better way to combat stress, anxiety and fatigue is a chin- dropping nap. Our so-called internal clock sounds the alarm for the needed Zs. ""There's always a dip in the level of alertness in the afternoon,"" said Dr. Lydia Wytrzes, director of Sutter Sleep Center in Sacramento. Late evening and afternoon are the two daily periods when our species tends to get sleepy-eyed. Our natural circadian rhythms kick in, begging for nap time. Trouble is, there's plenty to get in the way of a good nap--guilt, jobs, commute time, appointments. ""Our society has evolved to where napping is not part of our culture,"" Wytrzes said. Calhoun would voluntarily take naps as a child, and she said, ""Before I had children I'd come home from work, take a nap and then make dinner."" Now working full time, Calhoun savors naps on weekends. ""My naps are after lunch, about 1 p.m. or so,"" she said. ""It'll be for an hour or so. I'm not a power napper--20 minutes doesn't get it."" Calhoun, once a couch napper, now prefers her bed, atop the covers. ""I'm not remaking the bed,"" she said. ""I'm a lazy napper."" 10 SECRETS TO GREAT NAPS 1. Feet up. Prone is the best position. 2. Order some peace and quiet. Close the door. Turn off the lights. 3. Be comfortable. Slip into pajamas. At work, loosen tight clothing. 4. Keep it short. Rest for at least 15 minutes but aim for 30 minutes. 5. Don't watch the time on a clock. 6. Create a nap spot. 7. Keep it cool, 60-65 degrees. 8. Let go of stress. 9. Pamper your body. Yoga, a bath or massage can help you relax. 10. Breathe! Start quiet time with meditation, guided imagery or deep-breathing exercises. [SOURCE: JILL MURPHY LONG, AUTHOR OF ""PERMISSION TO NAP: TAKING TIME TO RESTORE YOUR SPIRIT""] NAPS SCIENTIFICALLY SPEAKING - Nap between 2 and 4 p.m. when you have the natural sleep drive and it won't disturb night sleep. - Don't nap in the early evening when your sleep clock is counting down for a good night's sleep. It will mess with your normal sleep pattern. - If you're napping in the mornings there's something wrong with your sleep. You should be alert after you've slept. - Often, a short nap of 15 or 20 minutes is equally or even more refreshing than a longer nap. More than 30 minutes and you may feel worse. - Teenagers are biologically wired to nap because they're sleep- deprived. Teens need about an hour of sleep more than adults to feel rested.

"12710",12710," 愼㸰 Every Tuesday: Discoveries, breakthroughs and trends; See related stories: 06D So you fall asleep the minute your head hits the pillow. You get drowsy after a glass of wine and you sleep in on Saturdays. You may think you're getting adequate sleep, but in fact there's a good chance you're sleep-deprived. Sleep scientists say we're a nation of people who aren't getting enough shuteye, cheating ourselves out of at least one hour of sleep a day. It makes us a menace to ourselves and others. Too little sleep means we're less alert, less productive and less efficient than we could be, and we're more prone to injuries and errors in judgment. We're also more likely to be forgetful, angry, cranky and irritable. This situation is likely to get worse as Americans trade sleep for work, television and other activities. It's a problem that experts will be addressing beginning March 30 during a weeklong public awareness campaign aimed at making Americans realize the importance of sleep. Right now, Americans average seven hours of sleep a night, and a third get six hours or less, says James Maas, a Cornell University professor of psychology who makes the case for snoozing more in his new book, Power Sleep (Villard, $25). Although sleep requirements vary, most people need eight hours a night to be at their best the next day and not experience a significant mid- afternoon drop in alertness and energy, Maas says. There are some people, he says, who do OK with seven to 7 hours a night. Few people function at their optimal level on less than six hours a night, and a few need 10 hours or more to function well, he says. Sleep deprivation varies So millions of people are walking around, going about their work and driving on the nation's highways while they are mildly to moderately sleep-deprived. Some people have more sleep problems than others: An estimated 20 million to 30 million people experience transitory sleep problems such as insomnia a couple of nights a month because of stress, anxiety, pain, illness and depression, says the National Sleep Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C. (Some experts say we all have transitory sleep problems.) About 25 million Americans have nontraditional work schedules that conflict with their natural sleep times, the group says. Up to 40 million Americans suffer from serious sleep disorders. About 10% of the population, or 20 million adults, have chronic insomnia, which is inadequate or poor quality sleep nightly for a month or more, says James K. Walsh, executive director and senior scientist at the Unity Sleep Medicine and Research Center at St. Luke's Hospital in St. Louis. An additional 10 million to 12 million have sleep apnea, a temporary cessation of breathing that causes a person to wake up without awareness during the night, according to the sleep foundation. Still others suffer from other sleep disorders including narcolepsy (a condition characterized by sudden and uncontrollable attacks of sleep) and restless-legs syndrome, a neurological disorder. Scientific evidence shows how widespread the problem of sleep deprivation is: Thomas Roth and researchers with the division of sleep medicine at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit surveyed 1,007 people and discovered they slept an average of 6.7 hours a night during the week. But, research indicates that the average American needs eight hours a night, Roth says. Roth analyzed 100 young adults who said they were fully alert after a night's sleep. But he found that 12% had very serious sleepiness and that 22% were moderately sleepy. Walsh and colleagues did a study of 10- to 14-year-old children. They had some of the children miss a half night of sleep. Those who slept less had fewer verbal skills the next day than children who got 9 hours of sleep. Why are we so sleepy? ""In the big picture, sleep has a low priority (for many people),"" Roth says. ""When something has to give, sleep gives."" People stay up late to watch television, surf the Net, do the laundry. Many people feel they need to work long hours to be successful. But sleep experts such as Maas say people would actually be more efficient and productive if they got enough sleep. Sleep deprivation costs Americans more than $100 billion annually in lost productivity, medical expenses, sick leave and property and environmental damage, the National Sleep Foundation says. And lack of sleep is dangerous. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that 100,000 police-reported motor vehicle crashes are caused by drowsy drivers every year. The price of lost hours Experts say loss of sleep is cumulative, creating a sleep debt. One hour of sleep loss every night for a week is the equivalent of staying up for an all-nighter, Maas says. Eventually your body tires and tries to make up for lost sleep with naps or extra sleep on the weekends. If people don't get enough shuteye, they may fall asleep in meetings or when driving. To get a good night's sleep, Maas recommends that people exercise regularly, stay mentally stimulated during the day, eat a proper diet, stop smoking, stop caffeinated food and drink at least six hours before bedtime, take a warm bath before going to bed and establish a bedtime ritual. It's best to avoid stewing about problems right before bedtime. Maas says one of the most common reasons for insomnia is stress. If you're in the habit of waking up at night or early in the morning worried about work, personal or family problems, he recommends that you keep a notepad on the nightstand and jot down a potential solution or a time during waking hours when you'll address the problem. Maas lectures to corporations across the nation, and he encourages people to learn the value of sleep. When people try his advice and get the recommended amount of sleep, he says, they often come back to him and say, ""I've never felt this awake before."" TEXT OF INFO BOX BEGINS HERE Determining whether you're sleep-deprived How do you know whether you're sleep-deprived? If you fall asleep immediately when you go to bed, you're not getting enough sleep. It should take you 15 to 20 minutes to fall asleep, doctors say. If a warm room, alcoholic beverage or boring lecture makes you drowsy, you are sleep-deprived. Most people think these situations cause sleepiness, but they just unmask sleepiness, says psychologist James Maas. If you've had enough sleep, a boring lecture may make you angry, irritable, bored or jittery, but it won't make you drowsy, he says. Here are some other ways to see whether you're sleepdeprived, from Maas' new book, Power Sleep. If three or more of the following describe you, it's possible that you need more sleep: I need an alarm clock in order to wake up at the appropriate time. It's a struggle for me to get out of bed in the morning. I feel tired, irritable and stressed out during the week. I have trouble concentrating. I have trouble remembering. I feel slow with critical thinking, problem solving, being creative. I often fall asleep watching television. I find it hard to stay awake in boring meetings or lectures, or in warm rooms. I often nod off after heavy meals or after a low dose of alcohol. I often feel drowsy while driving. I often sleep extra hours on weekend mornings. I often need a nap to get through the day. I have dark circles under my eyes. Illustration GRAPHIC, B/W, Grant Jerding, USA TODAY (Photo illustration); PHOTO, B/W, Mary Butkus, AP, for USA TODAY ",1998,"USA TODAY; McLean, Va."
"3219",3219," Although sleeping pills can help shift workers get an extra 50 minutes of sleep when they switch from day to night work, the extra sleep doesn't help them stay alert on the job. Researchers at Deaconess Hospital in St. Louis put healthy volunteers, eight men and 10 women, through two tours of simulated night shifts in which their sleep was delayed by nine hours for five days. On one tour they took a sleeping pill but not on the other. The study, reported in the current issue of Sleep, found that people have trouble adjusting to night work regardless of sleeping pill use. Over several days, the subjects became gradually more alert at night, even if they didn't sleep more during the day. Night workers never sleep as long or as well during the day as they do when they sleep at night, the researchers reported. The researchers concluded that sleeping pills may help some people get more rest if they have a very hard time sleeping during the day, but only for the first day or two after a shift change. ""We hasten to add,"" wrote James Walsh and the other researchers, ""that napping in the evening to increase total sleep time may be as helpful as extending the daytime sleep period"" with a sleeping pill.

"17723",17723," There's an (unpaid) internship from 9 to 5 -- then waiting tables three nights a week so you can actually pay the bills. And, of course, you have to spend some time out with your friends, or you'd just go crazy. So, when do you sleep? If the answer is ""rarely,"" your work could be suffering, as well as your health. Most people need about eight hours of sleep a night, but according to a National Sleep Foundation poll, 65 percent of Americans say they don't get enough. And while you might think you are more productive simply because you're awake, the facts suggest otherwise. Sleep deprivation makes you anxious, depressed, irritable and forgetful -- hardly the formula for doing your best work. Your sleep debt can also get you - - or someone else -- killed, if your body suddenly decides to nap while you're behind the wheel of a car. The National Sleep Foundation, a D.C.-based nonprofit organization, estimates that mistakes and accidents because of sleep deprivation cost businesses $18 billion a year. It certainly cost Exxon, back when a sleepy crew was steering a certain Exxon Valdez. And yet we young people tend to push the limits, often running on little more than our own ambition and copious amounts of coffee. Aaron Zegas, a first-year law student in Collingswood, N.J., says he's lucky to get six hours a night -- which still beats his sleep schedule at his last paying job, when he woke up at 6 a.m. to spend the day driving tourists around on a trolley-style bus. ""Now I can sleep till past 7 a.m. and that's really luxurious, or so it seems. On weekends, I tend to get adequate sleep. I know the whole 'catching up' thing doesn't exist, but it's still nice to get more- than-adequate sleep and not have to jump right out of bed."" He plays down the negative effects of his sleep schedule. ""Even on six hours or less, it hasn't affected my work during the day. . . . It's in the evening or at night when I feel less focused,"" said Zegas, 24. Why doesn't he get more? ""Either too much work, too much procrastination, or both,"" he said. He admits to falling asleep on the job a few times -- and has been caught. (Fortunately for D.C. tourists, this wasn't while he was driving the trolley.) ""I've worked jobs where it's in the official policy to fire workers caught asleep on the job, but fortunately this didn't happen. My boss just made fun of me."" At some jobs, though, it will be hard for your boss to find the humor in your nodding. Rick Goodell, a student and unemployed paramedic in New Orleans, once worked at a place where falling asleep would get you fired immediately: a maximum-security prison. He said that he stayed alert, despite the long hours and odd shifts. ""I almost fell asleep there, but luckily my thoughtful co- workers kept me awake by playing Terri Clark at full blast,"" said Goodell, 25. His work as a paramedic often kept him out late, so he has run into plenty of on-the-clock dozers. He said one of the strangest encounters was when he walked into a gas station where the attendant was asleep. ""That is not a job where I would sleep unless I could lock all the doors and there was reinforced glass or something."" Goodell said he aims to get his eight hours in but he can handle less. ""As long as I get at least five, I work normally, as long as there is not a lot of physical exertion. If I work a long shift -- over 12 hours -- in which I must be awake at all times, I begin to feel very taxed towards the end."" Courtney L. Patubo, a freelance graphic designer in the San Francisco Bay area, says she tries for eight hours a night, ""but it often doesn't feel like enough."" If she doesn't get the right amount of sleep, it hurts her work. ""It's a fine line. If I get too much sleep, I feel sluggish and sore, which definitely affects my speed, but not necessarily my productivity. I definitely feel a difference in productivity when I get less sleep. . . . All I could think about is getting back to bed, my eyes feel heavy, I actually feel like I am sick."" Like Zegas, she admits to falling asleep at work -- but she hasn't been caught. ""It is a rare occurrence. It was probably because I didn't have enough tasks to keep me busy, and I was just staring at a computer screen anyway."" And getting caught is generally about the worst that could happen to office workers. Not so for those whose jobs involve lots of driving, or handling heavy machinery or making life-or-death decisions. I hope they keep the rest of us in mind before they decide to skimp on sleep.

"22846",22846," When I was a kid, I had a Yorkshire terrier named Coco and a Siamese cat named Shan. The pair would sleep on my bed at night -- the cat near my head, the dog at my feet. And when my grandmother or grandfather would come into my room to check on me, Shan would hiss and Coco would growl. They weren't about to let anybody near me when I was asleep. I loved those animals and was devastated when they died. They remain leading characters in some of my fondest memories of youth. I've been thinking about Coco and Shan in recent months because my 7-year-old daughter has begun wanting a pet. When she announced this new desire, my knee-jerk response was ""No!"" We are busy enough without adding a pet to our daily chores. And given all my travel, the last thing my wife, Amy, needs is another obligation to deal with when I'm on the road. But then I started thinking about Coco and Shan, and it dawned on me that I had been looking at this too much like an adult. Pets, at least for me, were an integral part of childhood. And I realized that to understand my daughter's desire for one, I needed to stop thinking like Dad and start thinking like the pet-loving kid I used to be. How many times has the following scene played out? ""I want a pet,"" a child announces. ""No,"" a parent says. ""But why?"" comes the response, followed by the Big Lie: ""I promise to take care of it and feed it and..."" We all know that's not going to happen. Sure, your child might live up to that promise for a few days, maybe even a few weeks. But sooner or later, the pet is your daily chore. You're the one feeding the animal and taking care of its needs. Plus, pets can take a huge financial toll. There's the food you have to buy. There's the doghouse or the hamster wheel or the various bits and pieces that go into an aquarium. There are the vet visits and figuring out what to do with the animal when the family takes off for the day or weekend or week. No question about it: Pets are a pain -- difficult children that never grow up. No wonder parents often say no. And yet... I was talking the other day to my longtime Seattle friend, Jack, and he told me that last year he and his wife, Colleen, bought his 9-year-old daughter a golden retriever. He says she had been harassing them for a puppy, and ""was checking out books from the school library on dogs and constantly reminding us how responsible and ready she was for dog ownership."" Jack and Colleen didn't buy it. Nevertheless, Jack ultimately caved ""because I remembered the dogs I had growing up,"" he says. ""They were always traipsing around the neighborhood with us, and they never gave up the goods on us to our parents."" They deal with exactly what they expected: They have to remind their daughter to feed the dog, and forget trying to get her to clean up the mess when they take the dog for a walk. Still, he says, ""I figure it's part of the price of having a pet."" Now, their 7-year-old daughter wants a kitten. ""We'll see how soon I cave,"" he says. Another friend from New Jersey knows that scenario all too well. Although he dislikes cats, seven years ago, his then 8-year-old daughter was begging for one. ""My love for my daughter was greater than my hatred of cats, although only barely,"" he says. He ended up getting two cats (""long story,"" he says), and now, seven years later, he does at least half of the work. But, he says, the cats still sleep with his daughter every night, bringing her great comfort. ""In my softer moments,"" he says, ""I think it was worth it."" I like the idea of giving my daughter the responsibility of taking care of a pet. But I'm also realistic enough to know she's too young to fully live up to that responsibility. At 7, she's simply not going to always remember to feed the animal. And I have no illusions about the kitty litter. But she deserves a pet. She deserves to have an animal to call her own -- one that she loves and plays with, and one that loves her back. I may not have taken care of Coco and Shan as much as I should have. But they were my friends. I played with those animals all the time, and as an only child growing up without my parents nearby, I held onto them at night. They made me happy, and gave me a deep sense of affection for animals that I still have today -- despite my cranky, 44-year-old, knee-jerk rejection to my daughter's initial request for a pet. Amy and I want her to have the same experiences, even if that means we ultimately are the ones caring for and cleaning up after this animal. In fact, the only reason we haven't bought her a pet yet is that she's uncertain about what she wants. One week she was fixated on getting a gerbil or a guinea pig. But that quickly gave way to a rabbit. Then a friend from school let her keep four rabbits for several days earlier this month, and my daughter suddenly realized that maybe she doesn't want a rabbit after all. Good decision. Her latest fascination is small dogs, and particularly a dachshund. I'll let her stew on it another week or so before we make a final decision. But whatever we get, my hope is that she'll pick a pet that gives her a kind of love and affection she'll always remember. Just as I do. --- Jeff D.

"25269",25269," 愼㸰 Headnote The Workplace Fifty-eight percent of workers feel they do not get enough sleep, and 61% say lack of sleep has a negative impact on their work. However, as much as insufficient sleep affects workers' jobs, the reverse also is true: 44% of workers indicate that thinking about work keeps them up at night, according to a survey from CareerBuilder, Chicago, III. While eight hours may be the doctor-recommended amount of sleep time each night, only 16% of workers say they actually reach this goal. Some 63% log an average of six to seven hours of sleep each night during the workweek, while 21% average five hours or less. For some workers, hitting the snooze button in attempt to doze a little bit longer just does not cut it: 21% have called in sick for the purpose of getting extra sleep. Then there are those who simply try to catch up on sleep at the office: 43% have caught someone sleeping at work. Given this finding, it should come as no surprise that 39% of workers would take advantage of a designated ""nap room"" if offered at their place of work. ""Rest is an undervalued necessity these days,"" relates Rosemary Haefner, chief human resources officer at CareerBuilder. ""We see more and more workers check into the office at all hours of the day, give up vacation time, and work even when they're sick. Yet, ifs not necessarily making us more productive, and companies are starting to recognize that. ""We're starting to see companies put more emphasis on employee wellness and work-life balance- whether it's providing designated ?nap rooms' for employees, encouraging them to take advantage of their vacation time, or simply giving them more flexibility in their work schedules."" Sleep deprivation does not just hurt workers-it hurts business, too, as 61% of workers say lack of sleep has had an impact on their work in some way, including the following: it makes the day go by slower (30%); it makes me less motivated (27%); it makes me less productive (24%); it affects my memory (17%); it makes me crabby with coworkers (13%); it takes me longer to complete tasks (12%); and it causes me to make mistakes (11%).
